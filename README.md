## Installation and Setup

This project uses **UV**, a fast Python package installer and resolver, for dependency management.

### Prerequisites

You must have the **UV project manager** installed on your system.

### 1\. Setup UV (Windows)

Run the following command in your PowerShell to install the UV installer:

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

> **Note:** For non-Windows environments (Linux/macOS), please refer to the official [UV documentation](https://astral.sh/uv) for the appropriate installation command.

### 2\. Install Dependencies

Once UV is set up, navigate to the project root directory and run the following command. This will create a virtual environment and install all required packages:

```bash
uv sync
```

-----

## Usage

To  run the program, simply run the command below on the root directory.
```bash
uv run main.py
```
